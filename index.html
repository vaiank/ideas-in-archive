     <h1> How do i feel about getting to do research in Biophysics ?</h2>
     <h2> Introduction </h2>
     <p>Looking back in my life, now as a 24 year old, i am not quiet satisfied with how my life has been 
      till now. Havng said that, not everything was as bad as i make it sound. It's my pesimisim kikking in. 
      I will try to look at as many possible aspect of my last 10 years as possible to have an idea and pick out a pattern. 
      This analysis will probably help me to become more level headed and thoughtful during my decision making in the coming 
      days.
     </p>
     <p>The memories of my past encounters and feeling may not be 100 percent accurate, since there has been a lot of shift in frame in the past 10 years and that i'm currently writing it in a completely different frame of mind.
        I will make each milestone as a new heading.
     </p>
